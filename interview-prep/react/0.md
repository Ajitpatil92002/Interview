Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of **React.js** concepts to help you prepare for your SDE-2 interview:

### 1. **React Fundamentals**

- **JSX**: Syntax extension of JavaScript for writing UI. Understand how JSX works under the hood (gets compiled to `React.createElement`).
- **Components**: Functional vs Class components, how to structure components, reusable components.
- **Props**: Passing data between components, prop types, default props, and validation.
- **State**: Managing state with `useState`, understanding local vs global state.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: For class components: `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`.

### 2. **Hooks**

- **useState**: Managing local state in functional components.
- **useEffect**: Handling side effects like API calls, subscriptions, and cleaning up. Know dependency arrays and how to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **useContext**: Accessing global state and passing data without prop drilling.
- **useMemo & useCallback**: Optimization techniques to memoize values and functions, and avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Custom Hooks**: Building reusable logic encapsulated in hooks.

### 3. **Component Composition**

- **Lifting State Up**: Sharing state between parent and child components.
- **Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components**: Managing form inputs and their values.
- **Composition vs Inheritance**: Understanding React's preference for composition over inheritance.

### 4. **React Router**

- **Routing Fundamentals**: Setting up client-side routing with `react-router-dom`.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Handling route parameters, nested routes.
- **Programmatic Navigation**: Redirecting users programmatically via hooks like `useNavigate`.
- **Protected Routes**: Implementing authentication and authorization for certain routes.

### 5. **State Management**

- **Context API**: Managing global state with `React.createContext` and `useContext`.
- **Third-Party Libraries**: Introduction to popular state management libraries like Redux or Zustand.
- **Redux Basics**: Understanding `store`, `actions`, `reducers`, `dispatch`, and using hooks like `useSelector`, `useDispatch`.

### 6. **Handling Forms**

- **Form State Management**: Controlled components for forms, using `useState` or state management libraries.
- **Validation**: Client-side validation with custom logic or libraries like `Formik` and `Yup`.

### 7. **React Performance Optimization**

- **Reconciliation Algorithm (Virtual DOM)**: How React optimizes DOM rendering using the virtual DOM.
- **Memoization**: `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Lazy Loading Components**: Code splitting with `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.
- **React Profiler**: Identifying performance bottlenecks in your components.

### 8. **Error Handling in React**

- **Error Boundaries**: Catching and handling errors in the component tree, `componentDidCatch`, and `getDerivedStateFromError`.
- **Handling Asynchronous Errors**: Proper error handling in `useEffect` or Promises.

### 9. **Side Effects & Data Fetching**

- **useEffect for Side Effects**: Triggering API calls, subscriptions, and cleaning up resources.
- **React Query**: Managing server state, handling caching, pagination, etc., for data fetching.
- **Fetching Data**: Using libraries like Axios or native `fetch` inside React components.

### 10. **Context API vs Redux**

- **When to Use Context API**: Managing global state within small or simple apps.
- **When to Use Redux**: Large-scale state management, immutability, and debugging with middleware like `redux-thunk` or `redux-saga`.

### 11. **Testing in React**

- **Unit Testing with Jest**: Testing individual components or logic.
- **Integration Testing with React Testing Library**: Testing user interactions and rendering.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Tools like Cypress for testing the complete flow.

### 12. **React with TypeScript**

- **Types and Interfaces**: Defining props, state, and hooks with TypeScript.
- **Typing Hooks**: Correctly typing `useState`, `useReducer`, and other hooks.

### 13. **Common Interview Challenges in React**

- **Implementing Complex UI Components**: Building features like modals, accordions, and sliders.
- **Handling Side Effects in React**: Properly dealing with asynchronous data (e.g., multiple API calls).
- **Optimizing React Apps**: Identifying performance bottlenecks and applying optimizations.
- **HOC (Higher-Order Components)**: Building reusable logic using HOCs.

### 14. **React Ecosystem Tools**

- **Webpack/Babel**: Understanding the role of bundlers and compilers in building React apps.
- **Next.js (Optional)**: For server-side rendering, routing, and API integration.
- **Storybook**: Building isolated UI components and testing them in isolation.
